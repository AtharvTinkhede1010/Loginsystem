Login System with MySQL

This is a simple login and registration system where users can create accounts and log in using their credentials. The system is built with a Java backend, handling authentication and user data storage in a remote MySQL database. The frontend is designed with XML, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface. The application allows users to register with a username, email, and password, and securely checks login credentials for authentication.
